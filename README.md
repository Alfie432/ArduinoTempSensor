### A simple program that shows the temperature in C and humidity on a LCD display

# I've replaced the DHT11 with a TMP36, this is not correct wiring on the TMP36, it is the correct wiring for DHT11, the TMP36 is just there as a placeholder because TinkerCAD doesn't have it

Components used:
- Arduino Uno R3
- DHT11 Module
- LCD1602 no I2C
- 1 x 10k Potentiometer
- 1 x 220ohm resistor
- male-male jumper wires
- male-female jumper wires
